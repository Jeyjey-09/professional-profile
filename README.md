## 1. Project Overview
The Professional Profile Website is a 7-page static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates a personal profile including education, experience, skills, certifications, advocacy, and a portfolio layout (portfolio to be completed in final project).

## 2. File Structure
(Include the project structure block exactly as provided in README.)

## 3. Pages and Features
- `index.html` — Main page: menu/submenu, hero section, bio, sidebar, footer.
- `education.html` — Education details.
- `experience.html` — Work and project experience.
- `skills.html` — Skills with visual meters.
- `certs.html` — Certifications & training.
- `advocacy.html` — Advocacy and volunteer work.
- `portfolio.html` — Portfolio layout placeholder for the final project.

Common features:
- Responsive header and sidebar.
- CSS design theme with accessible contrast and simple animations via CSS transitions.
- Reusable CSS file and small JS utility file.
- Clear folder structure for easier extension.

## 4. Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Responsive layout)
- JavaScript (vanilla) for interactivity

## 5. How to Run Locally
1. Place the whole project folder on your machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (Chrome/Firefox).
3. For local testing of links and relative assets, no server required. For more realistic behavior, serve with `python -m http.server 8000` and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## 6. Notes for Final Project
- Portfolio page is a layout placeholder; fill with final projects and functional detail pages.
- Add contact form and backend (if required) in final project.

## 7. Submission Contents
- A `.txt` file containing the link to the project folder (Google Drive or GitHub).
- MIDTERM_DOCUMENTATION.pdf (this Markdown exported as PDF).
